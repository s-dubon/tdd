Test Driven Development
=======================

Goal of this project is for the team to see the default structure for a project :

- doc : where all the documentation goes
- test : where all the tests go
- lib : where all the code goes

Then main principal of test driven development is :
1) test what you want to do
2) implement the code to validate your test

My main reflection upon this is we should strive to :
1) document what we want to do
2) test the document
3) implement the code to validate your test

Somehow #1 is basically part of specifying your work
#2 is examples of what #1 defines
#3 is implementing the real deal.

If change is to be done on #2, should first do it on #1 so that everything cascades into place.
